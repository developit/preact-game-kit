This is a fork of the awesome [react-game-kit](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-game-kit), where React has just been aliased out for [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact).  Aside from simplifying the HMR setup (couldn't resist), no code was changed.

The bundle size after aliasing is **59kb**, and everything works identically!
